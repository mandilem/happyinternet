A collection of happy spaces on the internet

I built this fun, simple, and colorful website in about 8 hours (phew!). It was
inspired by a Chrome bookmark folder of mine called "break ðŸŒ±". In it, I've bookmarked
"just-for-fun" websites i.e. websites that serve no purpose other than fun or
distraction. I have all sorts of online games, music players, text-based-
generators, and super random things bookmarked. When I feel stressed or when
I get tired of the internet, I look through my "break ðŸŒ±" bookmark folder and pick
something to listen to/play/engage with. It's super fun :)

The most challenging part of this project was keeping by code DRY and knowing
when to use global classes vs when to use individual classes. I have so much room
for improvement, but I'm super excited about this small but impactful step
I've taken in my coding journey.

The best part of this project was seeing just how far I've come since I officially
started learning HTML and CSS, which was about 6 months ago! I was able to make
informed decisions about when CSS grid would best serve me over
flex-box and vice versa. Aaah, I'm so happy, and I hope you like this project!

Thanks for reading,
Mandile :)
